Here are some small projects I made using JavaScript

Projects:
----------
Pizza Menu: This is a menu used to order pizza with varying selection of toppings. It takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

Tic Tac Toe: The program randomly rolls a die to select which of two players goes first. Users can decide which token each player wants to use. There are sound effects for placing a move, when a player wins, and when there is a tie.

Calculator: A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
